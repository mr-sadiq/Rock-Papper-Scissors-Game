# Rock Paper Scissors Game

As part of my recent coding journey, I developed a Rock Paper Scissors game to strengthen my programming skills. This simple yet fun project allowed me to dive deep into game logic, user input handling, and implementing decision-making algorithms.

ðŸ”¹ Project Highlights:

User Interaction: A seamless interface allowing users to input their choice and play against the computer.
Logic Implementation: Built a decision-making algorithm to compare user input with the computer's random choice.
Outcome Feedback: Clear messaging on win, lose, or draw outcomes, improving user experience.
Technology Stack: Python (for logic), with potential for future expansions like a graphical interface using libraries like Tkinter or Pygame.
